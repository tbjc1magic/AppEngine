For the past few years, I am involved in multiple research collaboration from JINA(Michigan State University(MSU)), Florida State University(FSU), Notre Dame university(ND), Argonne National Laboratory(ANL) and Louisiana State University(LSU), and I primarily base at ANL, where I finished my thesis project "A Direct Study of 20Ne(alpha,p)23Na reaction using HELIOS". My everyday research work generally includes three folds: 1. Using simulations to design experimental setup, from sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation to naive kinematic calculation. Typically, I used C++ for all simulations, given the convenient toolkit Geant4 which includes all physics processes. Now I favor Python for more straight forward calculation, as the python codes are generally more immigrantable and can be easily deployed on a website without too much configuration tweaking. 2. Analyzing large set of experimental data and evaluating the statistical significance of resulted physical quantities. The typical tool I used for data analysis is "root", which is a powerful acedamic data analysis package base on C++. However, most companies do not quite know about it. This package integrates visualization tools, especially for displaying large data sets in various of histograms, and, being a widely used scientific package, it also includes most fitting functions and matrix calculation algorithms.  v
