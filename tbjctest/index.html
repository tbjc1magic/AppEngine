            <p>My name is Jianping Lai, a senior physics Ph.D. candidate at Louisiana Stat University. My research focuses on measuring nuclear reactions of astrophysical interest, specifically rp-process reactions related to Type 1a Supernovae, X-Ray Burst.</p>

            <p>For the past few years, I am involved in multiple research collaboration at JINA, Florida State University(FSU), Notre Dame university(ND), Argonne National Laboratory(ANL), and I primarily base at ANL, where I finished my thesis project "A Direct Study of 20Ne(alpha,p)23Na reaction using HELIOS". My everyday research work generally includes three folds: 1. Using simulations to design experimental setup, from sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation to naive kinematic calculation. Typically, I used C++ with Geant4 for most Monte Carlo simulations and Python for more straight forward calculations. One simulation, showing the protons data pattern at HELIOS, is included in this website. 2. I am responsible for analyzing large set of experimental data (~100 GB) and evaluating the statistical significance of resulted physical quantities. The primary tool I used for data analysis is "root", a powerful academic data analysis and visualization package based on C++.  3. Designing and developing the next generation heavy ion detector system, which includes the high precision cryogenic gas target system and the muli-channel position sensitive fast ionization chamber.</p>

            <p>Besides research related abilities, I have extensive interets in programming techniques, including basic Objective Oriented Programming, OpenCL (heterogenous platform computing), Machine Learning, and much more. And I am very interested in finding a job in related fields.</p>
